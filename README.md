# Picture Painting OpenCv

# Description
It is an Desktop based OpenCV project. Tkinter is used for GUI and Python is its core language.<br/><br/>

I have used cv2.xphoto.oilPainting() for Oil Painting of image, cv2.stylization() for Water colour painting of image and cv2.pencilSketch() for pencil sketch of the image.
